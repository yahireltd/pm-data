    summary: "Tickets can now carry file attachments — documents of any type and images — stored in Amazon S3 rather than crammed into the project data. On a ticket you can upload a file, see the list of what's attached, download documents, and open images in a full-screen viewer that zooms and pans (so the big flow diagrams are actually readable). The files live in cloud storage and the app hands out a short-lived private link each time you open one; nothing sensitive is exposed permanently. We deliberately built this to use the server's own cloud permissions (its instance role) so there are no passwords or keys stored anywhere — matching how the tool already reads its other secrets. IMPORTANT: this is finished in code but has NOT been tested against real storage yet, because it needs cloud setup that only you can do — an S3 bucket, the server's role granted permission to read/write that bucket, and the bucket name set in the server's environment. Until that's in place the feature stays safely switched off (it simply says attachments aren't set up). Once the bucket and permission exist, it should work end to end and needs a real-world check. Marked needs-review for exactly that reason."
    test_plan: |-
      ## Provision first (Austin — required, can't be done from code)
      1. Create an S3 bucket (private, not public).
      2. Grant the server's IAM instance role: `s3:PutObject`, `s3:GetObject`, `s3:DeleteObject` on that bucket (it should already have Secrets Manager via the same role).
      3. Set `PM_S3_BUCKET=<bucket-name>` (and `AWS_REGION`) in the server env; restart.

      ## Then verify on a deployed ticket
      1. Open a ticket → the "Files" section shows an Upload button.
      2. Upload a PDF → it appears in the list with size; click it → downloads/opens via a presigned link.
      3. Upload a large image (e.g. a flow diagram) → click it → the zoom viewer opens; +/- buttons and mouse-wheel zoom work, the image pans by scrolling, Reset returns to 100%, Close dismisses.
      4. Remove an attachment via ✕ → it disappears and the S3 object is deleted.
      5. As a stakeholder (read-only) → can view/download but sees no Upload/Remove.
      6. Files over 25 MB are refused with a clear message.

      ## Before provisioning (already true now)
      - With no PM_S3_BUCKET set, the Files section shows "No files attached" and Upload returns "Attachments storage isn't set up yet" — the rest of the ticket page works normally.

      Notes: bundling verified (`next build` compiles; the aws-CLI lib stays server-side, not in the browser). ADR-036 records the design. Uploads route through the Next server (25 MB cap).

Bucket created at [pm-tool-103898497059-eu-west-2-an](https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/pm-tool-103898497059-eu-west-2-an?region=eu-west-2)

The webserver IAM role has secrets manager and s3 access

Attachments storage isn't set up yet (no S3 bucket configured).

**2026-06-08 15:20 claude:** Thanks — bucket + role look right. The "not set up yet" message is because the app only learns the bucket name from a setting called `PM_S3_BUCKET`, and that isn't set on the live web service yet (the region, eu-west-2, already is and matches your bucket).

**One step to finish, on the server:** add the bucket name to the web service and restart it:

```
sudo systemctl edit --full pm-tool
# add under [Service], next to the existing AWS_REGION line:
Environment=PM_S3_BUCKET=pm-tool-103898497059-eu-west-2-an
# save, then:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart pm-tool
```

Then re-try uploading a file on a ticket. If it still errors after that, the role's S3 permission needs to include **PutObject, GetObject and DeleteObject** on `pm-tool-103898497059-eu-west-2-an/*` (a read-only S3 policy wouldn't allow uploads).

I've also added `PM_S3_BUCKET` to the deploy doc (commit 0779831) so it's recorded for next time.
