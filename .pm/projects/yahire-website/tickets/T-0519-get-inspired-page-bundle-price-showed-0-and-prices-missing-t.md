## Problem
On the **get-inspired** page (yahirenew), product cards had two pricing issues:
1. **Bundle/package products displayed £0** instead of a price.
2. Prices were rendered **without the `£` sign** (bare number).

## Root cause
Both come from `YahireNewSections::getProductCardFromStockID()` (the shared method that builds these cards):
- It read the price **only** from the product's `discountMatrix`. Bundles/packages have no discount-matrix rows, so `$price` was never set → the card fell back to `0`.
- It passed the **raw price number** to `productCard()` with no `£` and no formatting. The card template prints `$price` as-is (it expects the value to already include the `£` — hence the existing `ltrim($price, '£')`), so cards showed a bare number.

## Fix
In `getProductCardFromStockID()`:
- Initialise `$price`/`$priceText` (removes an undefined-variable warning).
- **Bundle fallback:** when there's no matrix price and the product is a package / multi-item bundle, use the existing `YaProducts::getBundleCalculatedPrice()` helper (sum of component `unitPrice × qty`) shown as "From £…".
- **Format both** normal and bundle prices as `£` + 2 decimals: `'£' . number_format($value, 2)`.

## Notes
- This method is shared, so the fix also corrects pricing on the other cards built by it (the hoxton/bodrum/skandi/lisbon/scaffold "table" cards).
- Caveat: a bundle's price comes from its `packageItems` (`unitPrice × qty`); if a bundle still shows £0, that package's items have no unit prices (a data issue, not code).
- Committed to `master` and deployed to live.

## Conversation

**2026-07-07 10:43 claude-code:** **Also part of this change (for the trace):** the **product selection** on the get-inspired page was updated — the stock-ID arrays in `YahireController::actionGetInspired()` (the black / ice / heritage / gold / urban-industrial selections, ~lines 5480-5541) were changed to swap which products appear. This is what surfaced the bundle-pricing bug (a newly-added bundle showed £0). Committed to `master` and live alongside the price fix.

Records: docs updated (getBundleCalculatedPrice.md); tech-session none-needed; status-note none-needed.

**2026-07-08 08:35 claude-code:** **Follow-up fix (same method, get-inspired bundle cards): the card URL link wasn't showing for bundle items.**

Root cause — `YahireNewSections::getProductCardFromStockID()` builds the card URL by looping the product's category assignments and taking the one whose `canonicalURL` *contains* the product's `urlLink` (a `strpos` match). For bundles that match fails, so `$url` stayed empty and the card rendered with no link.

Fix — added a fallback: when `$url` is still empty after the normal loop, pull the product's canonical URL directly from `ya_url_routes` (keyed by `stockID` + `canonicalURL = 1` + `websiteID`) — the same source the newer listing code uses. Non-bundle products are unaffected (original path runs first; fallback only fires when the URL would otherwise be blank).

Caveat: only works if the bundle has a canonical route in `ya_url_routes`; a bundle with no canonical entry will still show no link (data fix, not code).

File: `common/models/YahireNewSections.php` — `getProductCardFromStockID()` (~line 2452, right after the canonical-URL loop). On `master`.
